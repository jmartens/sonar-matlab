<p>
Although both lower case 'l' and upper case 'L' are allowed as suffix for long integers, it is strongly recommended to always use 'L', since the letter 'l' looks too much like the digit '1'.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule :

<pre>
return 1l  # Non-Compliant
return 1L  # Compliant
</pre>
