<p>
Python has no pre/post increment/decrement operator.
For instance, x++ or x-- will fail to parse.
More importantly, ++x or --x will do nothing.
To increment a number, simply write x += 1.

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>

<pre>
++x     # Non-Compliant
x += 1  # Compliant
</pre>
